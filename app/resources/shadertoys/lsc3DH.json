It also simplifies \n    the code enough to afford some shadows, ambient occlusion and reflections.\n    \n    The process is pretty simple: In essence, you partition space into cubic blocks, render a \n    Truchet tile using three toroidal shapes (each designed to enter one cube face and exit another), \n    then randomly rotate each block. 3D Truchet tiling is one of those things that's so easy to \n    implement, once you get the hang of it, but can be painful on your first go.\n    \n    I'll release a more simplified example with less cost cutting and window dressing soon, for \n    anyone who might be interested. I might release something with some different tile \n    variations (4 spheres in four corners, etc) as well.\n    \n    By the way, I welcome any improvements, corrections, etc.\n    \n    Other 3D Truchet examples:\n    \n    I love this, and so do many others.\n    Truchet Tentacles - WAHa_06x36\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ldfGWn\n    \n    Truchet tiling on a 3D simplex grid.
