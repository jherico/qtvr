Like bh's example, this one is branchless. In fact, there's\n\tvirtually no code at all.\n\n\tAs mentioned below, 3-tap Voronoi is just a novelty, bordering on pointless, but I thought \n\tit might provide a basis for anyone wishing to build a 3D simplex version. I also have a \n\t4tap Voronoi function that involves even less computation.\n\n\tBy the way, the pattern is supposed to be concave. The reason I mention that is, if I stare \n\tat a highlighted Voronoi pattern for too long, it sometimes looks inverted. Usually, I have \n\tto close my eyes and reopen them to reinvert it. I've often wondered whether that happens to \n\teveryone, or whether I'm just getting old. :)\n\n\t\/\/ Other Shadertoy examples:\n\n\t\/\/ Hexagonal Voronoi - By \"bh\":\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ltjXz1 - I'm looking forward to the finished version. :)\n\n\t\/\/ Voronoi fast, a 2x2 grid, 4tap version - By \"davidbargo\":\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/4tsXRH\n\n*\/\n\n\n\n\/\/ Standard 2x2 hash algorithm.\nvec2 hash22(vec2 p) { \n\n    \/\/ Faster, but probably doesn't disperse things as nicely as other ways.\n    float n = sin(dot(p,vec2(41, 289))); \n    p = fract(vec2(8.0*n, n)*262144.);\n    return sin(p*6.2831853 + iGlobalTime*2.);\n    \n\/* \n\treturn fract(sin(p)*43758.5453)*2.-1.;\n    \n    \/\/p = fract(sin(p)*43758.5453);\n\t\/\/p = sin(p*6.2831853 + iGlobalTime);\n    \/\/return sign(p)*0.25 + 0.75*p;\n    \n    \/\/p = fract(sin(p)*43758.5453)*2.-1.;\n    \/\/return (sign(p)*0.25+p*0.75);    \n *\/   \n    \n}\n\n\/\/ 3-tap Voronoi... kind of. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who's thought to try this.\n\/\/\n\/\/ Due to the simplex grid setup, it's probably slightly more expensive than the 4-tap, square \n\/\/ grid version, but I believe the staggered cells make the patterns look a little nicer. I'd \n\/\/ imagine it's faster than the unrolled 9-tap version, but I couldn't say for sure. Anyway, \n\/\/ it's just a novelty, bordering on pointless, but I thought it might interest someone.\n\n\/\/ I'm not perfectly happy with the random offset figure of \"0.125\" or the normalization figure \n\/\/ of \"0.425.\" They might be right, but I'll determine those for sure later. They seem to work.\n\/\/\n\/\/ Credits: Ken Perlin, Brian Sharpe, IQ, various Shadertoy people, etc.\n\/\/\nfloat Voronoi3Tap(vec2 p){\n    \n\t\/\/ Simplex grid stuff.\n    \/\/\n    vec2 s = floor(p + (p.x+p.y)*0.3660254); \/\/ Skew the current point.\n    p -= s - (s.x+s.y)*0.2113249; \/\/ Use it to attain the vector to the base vertice (from p).\n\n    \/\/ Determine which triangle we're in.
