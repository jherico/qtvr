I've aired on the side of caution and called it \"quasi infinite,\" \n\tjust in case it doesn't adhere to his strict infinite zoom standards. :)\n\n\tSeriously though, I put together a couple of overly optimized versions a couple of days ago,\n\tjust for fun, and Fabrice's comments were pretty helpful. I also liked the way he did the \n\tlayer rotation in his \"Infinite Fall\" version, so I'm using that. The rest is stock standard \n\tinfinite zoom stuff that has been around for years.\n\n\tMost people like to use noise for this effect, so I figured I'd do something different\n\tand use Voronoi. I've also bump mapped it, added specular highlights, etc. It was \n\ttempting to add a heap of other things, but I wanted to keep the example relatively simple.\n\n\tBy the way, most of the code is basic bump mapping and lighting. The infinite zoom code \n\ttakes up just a small portion.\n\t\n\n\tFabrice Neyret's versions:\n\n\tinfinite fall - short\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ltjXWW\n\n    infinite fall - FabriceNeyret2\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/4sl3RX\n\n\tOther examples:\n\n    Fractal Noise - mu6k\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Msf3Wr\n\n    Infinite Sierpinski - gleurop\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/MdfGR8\n\n    Infinite Zoom - fizzer\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/MlXGW7\n\n\tPrivate link to a textured version of this.\n\tBumped Infinite Zoom Texture - Shane\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Xl2XWw\n\n\n*\/\n\n\nvec2 hash22(vec2 p) { \n\n    \/\/ Faster, but doesn't disperse things quite as nicely.
