The problem, of \n\tcourse, is pretty severe antialising. Here's an attempt to rectify that without resorting \n\tto expensive methods.\t\n\n\tThe contour lines are relatively smooth and concise, regardless of the shape of the curve. \n\tThere are probaly better ways to go about it (I'd be happy to hear about any), but this \n\tmethod works pretty well.\n\n\tIn addition, I've written a reasonaly simple 2D simplex related noise algorithm to accompany\n\tthis. It probably doesn't adhere to strict simplex noise standards, but it looks the part, \n\tand is artifact\tfree - as far as I can tell, so it's good enough for me. :) It also provides \n\ta good basis for cheap 3D simplex related noise.\n\n\tI wrote the simplex-like algorithm off the top of my head ages ago, so I wouldn't take it \n\ttoo seriously.
